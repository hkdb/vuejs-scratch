      <h2>History</h2>
      <p class="org-description is-size-4">The 3DF Open Source Initiative (OSI) was born within 3DF Limited, a Hong Kong based IT Ops, DevOps, and 3D Printing Consultancy. It began when the founder decided to develop some practical IT tools and decided to share the source code with the community he was involved in. Starting from simple scripts running in *nix terminals slowly grew to even more graphically rich software utilities that solved everyday needs for IT professionals. He then found himself so fascinated with re-engaging in coding, something that he hasn’t done much of since much earlier in his career, he thought that not only did he very much enjoyed the experience, he also learned a lot more that was very much valuable and re-applicable to his professional life. As such, he decided that he wanted to share this experience with the rest of the company and began his journey in building what’s now known is 3DF Open Source Initiative.</p>
      
      <h2>What is OSI?</h2>

      <p class="org-description is-size-4">OSI is a platform to introduce and share open source technologies consisting of mostly server side scripts, team collaboration tools, and small utility software like our PDF compressors built for Linux desktops users. Contributors range from founders and staff of 3DF working on both work related and personal projects all the way to contributors from our partners and friends. The goal is to sustain a platform for sharing resources in every aspect of running successful open source projects and to participate in the greater Open Source community together.</p>
